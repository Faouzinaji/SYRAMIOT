Hello Dear Mr jovinpizarro!

I think you dont need to have a database for this task.
You should reside your csv files on any cloud(mediafire,cloudinarystorage,github or google drive)
after residing your csv files on any cloud you can read them in your code.
These cloud files will act as backend for your code.
I am also sending you a example and a youtube link for this purpose

urlfile = 'https://res.cloudinary.com/hmmpyq8rf/raw/upload/v1604671300/localisationDigixpress_n8s98k.csv'

df = pd.read_csv(urlfile)


or you can watch following youtube link
