Dear Colleagues,


We will be reducing employee hours by one day per week.
This temporary furlough is expected to last 3 months and is essential to avoid major layoffs.

Leadership takes full responsibility for the lack of foresight leading to the churn of a major client, and will ensure more resilient client acquisition in the future.


Best Regards,

John the CEO
